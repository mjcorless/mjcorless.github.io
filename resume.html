                <ul>Teams I have worked on:
					<li>Engineering Drawing Tracker Website (May 2016 - August 2016, May 2017 - August 2017)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Release notes of user affecting changes <small>(I wrote all of the code and was responsible for testing each of these changes. They were code reviewed by one or two senior developers before being committed to production)</small>:<a href="https://mjcorless.github.io/resources/pdf/EDT2016.pdf">2016</a>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://mjcorless.github.io/resources/pdf/EDT2017June.pdf">June 2017</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://mjcorless.github.io/resources/pdf/EDT2017August.pdf">August 2017</a></li>
						<li>Worked various bugs and tasks on TFS including: generating Word, PDF, and Excel reports, adding new features such as bulk profile processing, and general bug-fixing.</li>
						<li>Languages/Frameworks: C#, ASP.NET, CSS, HTML, Javascript, SQL (and T-SQL), JQuery, BootStrap</li>
						<li>Tools used: Microsoft SQL Server Management, Team Foundation Server, Visual Studios</li>
						<ul>Examples of work:
							<li>Added front-end and back-end logic to allow users to advance, challenge, and reject drawings assigned to them
									in bulk instead of having to perform actions on each individual drawing. This utilized javascript for client side logic on which profiles could
									be selected together, server side logic to perform the bulk processing (profile status change, bulk emailling, etc). I was able to multi-thread 
									these processes so that it could operate 3-4 times faster (on my devolopment environment) but I switched teams before it was tested enough to be put in production.</li>
							<li>Created History database table and supporting C# classes that would track every change a user made to a profile in one session 
									and would save the changes in a compact JSON string. Created a webcontrol to display every change in a profile since its creation, 
									the user that committed the change, and the date of the change</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Viper Change Management Website(May 2016 - August 2016, May 2017 - August 2017)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Created in depth user guides for each VCM process (VCR, Airworthiness, FOSTR, CSI, Flight Forms)</li>
						<li>Tested various changes by two senior developers before each VCM release.</li>
						<li>Created a new user input for VCRs and an RDLC report that would display each VCR with 'yes' selected.</li>
						<li>Created a new multi-view that would display a dropdown to users with specific roles to change the location of a VCR, therefore changing the VCR name. 
							Users without the specific permissions would see the name of the VCR as a non-editable label.</li>
						<li>Languages/Frameworks: C#, ASP.NET, SQL (and T-SQL), XML, CSS, HTML,</li>
						<li>Tools used: Microsoft SQL Server Management, Team Foundation Server, Visual Studios</li>
					</ul>					
					<li>Automated Weight and Balance System(August 2017 - November 2017)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>In this team I was given more responsibility. I took online training for U.S. export laws in order to have access to production databases containing a variety 
							of sensitive information (nothing requiring a security clearance). Responsible for entire development process (setting up my own enviroment, writing code, 
							testing my own changes, and pushing those changes to production). 
							<small>In previous teams I only wrote code, tested the changes, and committed to the main branch after a code review.</small></li>
						<li>Created RESTful webservices/API to allow mobile client (using a local SQLite database) to communicate with server (SQL Server database).</li>
						<li>Created entire SQL Server database, setting proper datatypes/lengths and triggers to mimick cascading delete for foreign keys. </li>
						<li>Worked on various tasks and features for AWBS (U.S. military) and CAWBS (ally countries) websites.</li>					
						<li>Languages/Frameworks: C#, .NET(primarily ASP.NET, some Xamarin), SQL (and T-SQL), CSS, HTML,</li>
						<li>Tools used: Microsoft SQL Server Management, Team Foundation Server, Visual Studios, SQLite Browser, Virtual Machine for Test Server, Agile process</li>
