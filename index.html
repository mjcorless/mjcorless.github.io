			<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>[EDT August 2016 Release](mjcorless.github.io/resources/pdf/EDT2016AugustRelease.pdf)</li>
					<li>[EDT June 2017 Release](mjcorless.github.io/resources/pdf/EDT2017JuneRelease.pdf)</li>
					<li><a href="#" onclick='showVCRDropDown();'>Unfortunately I did not get permission to show releases for VCM. However, here are some of the features I added:</a></li>
					<ul ID="VCRDropDown" style="display:none">
						<li>User guides for each of the VCM modules...</li>
						<li>Multi-View html component that shows a location dropdown for users with specific roles to change the location property of a Viper Change Request's name.
							Users without the role would just see an uneditable label that included the location in the VCR name.</li>
						<li>Created radio button in VCR ViewEdit page. If the 'yes' button was selected then the VCR would showup in the corresponding RDLC report I made.</li>
						<li>Admin tool that allows admins and users with specific roles to search for comments throughout the site. Tool allows the user to search with the comment's
							date, commenter's name/email, and .... It also allows us to search for auto-generated and user type comments that were within x minutes of each other so that we
							could find comments that were not standardized to the new comment format throughout the site.</li>
					</ul>
