								<h4 class="widget-title">About Me</h4>
								<div>
									<p>My name is Matthew Corless. I am a senior at Arizona State University studying for a B.S. in Software Engineering. I am currently working for Lockheed Martin. 
										I interned Lockheed Martin for 4 months in the summer of 2016. I initially started a co-op with them for the summer of 2017 but this turned into a full-time
										employment when my manager realized I could do my last semester online. I currently work on Lockheed's Automated Weight & Balance System. Every aircraft in the Department
										of Defense uses our AWBS software in order to generate flight forms for every mission. The AWBS team consists of ten developers utilizing agile and scrum.
										Our primary project is a Xamarin client that will be released June 2018.
									</p>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square">My responsibilities on my current team include:
										<li>Primary developer for both of our ASP.NET websites. I am responsible for the full development cycle of both websites including planning, design,
											implmentation, deployment, and maintenance. <small><a href="https://cs.lmaeronautics.com">cs.lmaeronautics.com</a> (foreign customers) and
												<a href="https://awbs.hill.af.mil">https://awbs.hill.af.mil</a> (DoD site, CAC required)</small></li>
										<li>Primary developer for RESTful API being developed for our Xamarin application. This is the first REST API for LM Aeronautics and I work
											closely with Fort Worth network engineers to establish secure web services.</li>
										<li>Creating and maintaining the server database (SQL Server) throughout development as the client schema changes.</li>
										<li>Setting up various servers for us to use for internal testing and for Beta tests with sanitized data. This includes setting up Windows Server, SQL Server, and IIS)</li>

							<h3>Current AWBS Team (August 2017 - )</h3>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5>REST API</h5>
								<p>When I joined the team the API was a simple prototype using SQLite for the databases. I took the prototype to a finished product. This involved updating
								the entire project to use SQL Server, updating the schema, redoing the authentication, handling error codes, writing new API calls as needed, and working with
								Lockheed network engineers to make the REST API secure. Since this is the first LM Aeronautics REST API I have needed to work closely with them so we can
								make the services secure enough for Lockheed Martin standards (schema validation, two-factor authentication, etc.)
							</div>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5><a href="https://cs.lmaeronautics.com">cs.lmaeronautics.com</a></h5>
								<p>This website is a public facing site meant for our foreign customers.
								</p>
								<ul>Tasks I completed were:
									<li>Added functionality to upload and download software.</li>
									<li>Created a system to allow users to download software based on their need and the currently valid agreements with their country.
									This allowed us stop relying on an external site and allowed us to host our own software on our site. This change directly led to
									more users and opened doors to contracts with more foreign countries.</li>
									<li>Added functionality for Fort Worth engineers to create and upload modifications. These modifications are primarily used for F-35s and
									adjust the aircraft's weight and balance record in the database based on the type of modification.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5><a href="https://awbs.hill.af.mil">awbs.hill.af.mil</a></h5>
								<p>This site is for our Department of Defense users. It acts as a central repository for software products and user permissions for our
									web services. I primarily maintain the website and only work on it if something breaks if there is a high priority task. Most of my
									additions to this site are in preparation of our new AWBS client coming out this summer.
								</p>
								<ul>Tasks I completed were:
									<li>Updated authentication with CAC cards after the DoD created a new edge server that broke our old authentication.</li>
									<li>Added functionality for Fort Worth engineers to create and upload modifications. These modifications are primarily used for F-35s and
										adjust the aircraft's weight and balance record in the database based on the type of modification.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5>SOAP Web Services (for both sites listed above)</h5>
								<p>These are our legacy web services that have been used for the past 10 years. I don't work on them unless something breaks breaks for one
									of the sites.
								</p>
								<ul>Bugs I fixed were:
									<li>Fixed a race-condition bug that was causing power users to lose permissions. This bug existed for over two years and led to countless headaches
									that multiple developers could not figure out.</li>
									<li>Added functionality to ensure users with permissions for multiple countries do not accidentally upload an aircraft to the wrong country.</li>
									<li>Updated authentication for the DoD web services after the DoD created a new edge server that broke our old authentication.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5>Xamarin client</h5>
								<p>I have not worked on the client as much as I would like to. Most of my work in the client is code reviewing others (we require two code reviews
									for each check-in). Something I did do was create a logging feature to log any unhandled exceptions and non-200 API responses. I added an API
									call to sync these JSON logs with the server so we can look at issues the users are having. A future update will likely have a log viewer for
									the the user to contact our support line with.
								</p>

							<h3>Past Projects as an intern (May 2016 - August 2016 and May 2017 - August 2017)</h3>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5>Viper Change Management Website</h5>
								<p>As an intern I worked on the Viper Change Management (VCM) website. VCM started as a website repository for all f-16 change requests in the world. It has expanded through the
									years to store other repositories related to f-16 and other aircraft.
								</p>
								<ul>Tasks I completed were:
									<li>Created in depth user guides for each VCM process (VCR, Airworthiness, FOSTR, CSI, Flight Forms)</li>
									<li>Tested various changes by two senior developers before each VCM release.</li>
									<li>Created a new user input for VCRs and an RDLC report that would display each VCR with 'yes' selected.</li>
									<li>Created a new multi-view that would display a dropdown to users with specific roles to change the location of a VCR, therefore changing the VCR name. 
										Users without the specific permissions would see the name of the VCR as a non-editable label.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="project-item">
								<h5>Engineering Drawing Tracker Website</h5>
								<p>As an intern I primarily worked on the EDT website. EDT is a small internal website used in conjunction to VCM to keep track of drawings for 
									Viper Change Requests. Before the website Lockheed engineers needed to track their hours worked and overall status for each drawing in spreadsheets. The website also 
									enforces a strict process flow for each drawing type. The complex process flows allow engineers to challenge drawings assigned to them, reject a drawing to a previous 
									state, and advance a drawing to the next state. Gatekeepers, or users with a manager role, can assign, recall, cancel, and put drawings on-hold.
								</p>
								<ul>Tasks I completed were:
									<li>Release notes of some of the changes I implemented:
										<a href="https://matthewcorless.me/pdf/EDT2016.pdf">2016</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://matthewcorless.me/pdf/EDT2017June.pdf">June_2017</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
										<a href="https://matthewcorless.me/pdf/EDT2017August.pdf">August_2017</a>				
									</li>
									<li>Worked various bugs and tasks on TFS including: fixing hour tracking throughout the site, generating Word, PDF, and Excel reports, and adding new features such as bulk profile processing.</li>
									<ul>Examples of work:
										<li>Added front-end and back-end logic to allow users to advance, challenge, and reject drawings assigned to them
											in bulk instead of having to perform actions on each individual drawing. This utilized JavaScript for client-side logic on which profiles could
											be selected together, server-side logic to perform the bulk processing (profile status change, bulk emailling, etc). I was able to multi-thread 
											these processes so that it could operate 3-4 times faster (on my development environment) but I switched teams before it was tested enough to be put in production.</li>
										<li>Created History database table and supporting C# classes that would track every change a user made to a profile in one session 
											and would save the changes in a compact JSON string. Created a web control to display every change in a profile since its creation, 
											the user that committed the change, and the date of the change.</li>
									</ul>

								<h5>Converter</h5>
								<p>This application is "another converter app" that converts between decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal. However, this app also shows the user how
									to do each conversion. The repository was set-up for continuous integration with Travis CI and Maven. Over winter break (2017-2018) I started to
									build an android version of this with more functionality. The android portion is still a work in progress and likely will not be finished until the
									summer of 2018 when I will have more time to work on personal projects.</p>

							<div class="project-item">
								<h5>matthewcorless.me</h5>
								<p>This is the simple single page application (SPA) you are currently viewing. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan on building upon over
									time. I got the idea when I found out 'ME' domains are free for one year for students and that websites can be hosted on GitHub for free.
									Currently the website acts as a bloated resume but I hope to add to it more in the future.
